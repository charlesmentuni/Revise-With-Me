# Revise With Me
This is a web application created as a result of attending the pre-incubator program at the University of Exeter. Revise With Me allows the user to share their revision with their classmates to promote a collaborative work environment. 

## Market Validation
From the funding I received from the University of Exeter pre-incubator programme, I sent out a survey to 142 respondents. After describing the idea to the participants, I asked a series of questions.
### Results
 - 54.23% of participants responded that they would be either very likely or extremely likely to use this tool.

## Features
Currently, the features of this service are:

 - Buddy: a friend who can verify that you've completed the work and motivate you to do more.

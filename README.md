# Revise With Me
This is a web application created as a result of attending the pre-incubator program at the University of Exeter. Revise With Me allows the user to share their revision with their classmates to promote a collaborative work environment. 

## Features
Currently, the features of this service are:
 - A page where you will be able to post your revision, along with the number of hours spent revising.
 - Buddys: a friend who can verify that you've completed the work and motivate you to do more.

Performing surveys on this idea gave some very interesting results. 54.23% of participants responded that they would be either very likely or extremely likely to use this tool.
